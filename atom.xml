      &lt;p&gt;GPG, Gnu Privacy Guard, is a popular and wide used encryption tool
compatible to PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) tool. By using widely-accepted 
asymmetric encryption methods, GPG becomes an handy utility for
signing digital information with a personal or organizational credential
or securing private or sensitive message with high level encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is to integrate GPG with Git for more reliable and controllable source code management.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;NPM is the most used package manager for node.js and JavaScript ecosystems.
By using the global packages mechanism, a node.js package can be easily integrated 
into system shell and just works like a native command line utility (or even an 
desktop GUI program). However, by default, the global packages are installed as shared 
global packages across users and requires root privilege for maintenance, which may be
unavailable for general user and also expose potential conflict of packages between 
users. This post will cover simple configuration for npm global package for current 
user only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Service is another information exchange mechanism provided in ROS which 
provides RPC (remote procedure call) style request-response pattern.
The service is defined by &lt;code&gt;.srv&lt;/code&gt; file, which can be treated as a combination
of two message representing service request and service reply, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Messages are spread across the whole system of a ROS instance,
which are the essence and physical base of communication and coordination 
in ROS system. The message is a serializable and platform agnostic (in the 
perspective of OS, programming language, etc) specification of structured data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of information in this post is refer to &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.ros.org/msg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;msg page in ROS wiki&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ros/ros/blob/kinetic-devel/core/roslib/src/roslib/msgs.py&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;source code for ROS core module&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A directly connected concept in ROS is &lt;em&gt;Topic&lt;/em&gt;, which is named bus for message exchange, which will be covered in later post. The &lt;em&gt;Service&lt;/em&gt; is also based on 
the infrastructure of message, which will be illustrated in next post.&lt;/p&gt;
