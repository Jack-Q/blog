> Finally, it started \... \...

I have been plannning to have a blog of mine for
a long time. However, owing to all kinds of different 
problems, this work still stay in the status of
*UNDERCONSINDERATION*. Last year, I started to 
implement one in `PHP` by doing everything required 
by a blog-like site. However, though that one had been
coded for about two weeks including the process of 
web page design, finally I was interrupted by an 
important person who had helped me a lot and asked 
me for assist. Form then on, my project of a self-blog
site have no progress.

From this post, I decided to *finally* (really, it\'s true) 
start my blog and the first series of blog posts is 
the building process log of the blog itself. That is to do
blog while to build the blog.

Before this turly start of blog buliding (I hope so,
indeed.) , I have searched, experienced, tested, evaluated 
or designed some kinds of blog system or blog site
management. And eventually, considering the convenience,
accessibility, limitation of all the possible solution, I
decided to use Jekyll as blog engine, and plan to host it
on GitHub.

Jekyll blog engine can gengerate totally static web pages
that only need some basic resource provided by the server,
which means less configure on server application and less 
efforts on remote application deployment and management.
Besides, Jekyll\'s design of site management is more depend
on some simple convensions between the blogger and the 
engine instead of applying redundent restraint to blogger
to ensuer the proper fuctionality of the program. As a
result, there is nearly full control of me to set the
template, adding scriptand styles, etc.

To use Jekyll from scartch, some basic skills are surely 
required. I pick some of the requirement I perseve.

 * markdown syntax (quite easy to learn)
 * front end skills
 * linux operate
 * git and GitHub (if you want to host the blog on GitHub)
 * \...

Though it is possible to run all of the things on Windows,
I personally still highly recommend everyone who want to 
build a Jekyll site use Linux as their work environment.

Then, let\'t dive into the world of Jekyll. 

In the following posts, I will start form environment 
installing and site structure constructing, which will 
be the basic of this site.
