> Finished it, at last.

In the past two weeks, fully devotion was paid on the task
 (May be also a project) about on the field of the front-end
web coding. During that time, a small group of primers (in 
the front-end web development) were working together on a small 
site as a task, the goal of which is to clone the front-end
part of one of the most popular sites nationwide. And finally, 
not only have we finished the cloning of its front-end part, 
but also have added some back-end components to it that make
the site more dynamic. Here after the task, I want to summarize
the gains and faults.
