Migrate to [Hexo](https://hexojs.io/).

<!-- more -->

## Reasons

The main consideration of the migration from `Jekyll` to `Hexo` is
from the accessibility of environment setup and customizability of
the generation process. Basically, `Jekyll` is written in ruby as well 
as most of the plugins in that eco-systems. Because [GitHub](https://github.com/) 
is mostly implemented their web front end based on Ruby on Rails, Jekyll
is more flavorable from them to choose as default static site generator for 
GitHub Pages service. 

However, personally speaking, JavaScript is more bueatiful for me. Thus, a 
JavaScript based static site generator is a more attractive choice. Thus,
the site is migrated from `Jekyll.rb` to `Hexo.js`
